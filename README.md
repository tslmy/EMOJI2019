Code that accompanies the paper Exploring (Dis-)Similarities in Emoji-Emotion Association on Twitter and Weibo at EMOJI2019.

Main code file is the Notebook `EMOJI2019 - After Models Are Trained.ipynb`.

`data.hdf` contains aggregated tables that we used to derive our results in the paper. A description of what's inside can be found in `Keys in the HDF file.md`.

The Notebook contains visualization code which makes use of `RadarChartsTemplate.html`. The HTML file in turn requires files in `assets/` to render the radar charts properly.
